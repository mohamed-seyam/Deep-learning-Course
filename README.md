# Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera (offered by deeplearning.ai)


Instructor: [Andrew Ng](http://www.andrewng.org/)


## Credits

This repo contains my work for this specialization. The code base, quiz questions and diagrams are taken from the [Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning), unless specified otherwise.

## 2021 Version

This specialization was updated in April 2021 to include developments in deep learning and programming frameworks, with the biggest change being shifting from TensorFlow 1 to TensorFlow 2. This repo has been updated accordingly as well.
